# ACF Rating Field

ACF Rating Field is a Wordpress plugin adding a new ACF field to manage ratings with decimal numbers. The default rating symbol is a star ("â˜…") but it can be customised.

Here are examples for a rating of 3.6 out of 5:

## Installation

- Download the [latest version on GitHub](https://github.com/misaki-web/acf-rating-field/releases/latest/download/acf-rating-field.zip).

- Extract the archive and copy the folder (`acf-rating-field`) to the Wordpress plugins folder (`/wp-content/plugins/`).

- Go to the Wordpress plugins manager on your website (`your-website.ext/wp-admin/plugins.php`) and enable the plugin **ACF Rating Field**. Note that you can enable auto-updates.

## Usage

### Admin

Go to the ACF administration page (`your-website.ext/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=acf-field-group`), add a new field group and choose the field **Rating**:

Change the field settings as needed.

### Front-end

To display the field value, the shortcode `acf_rating_field` can be used. By default, it'll look at custom fields for the current post where the shortcode is added. For example, the following shortcode:

	[acf_rating_field name="FIELD_NAME"]

is the same as this one:

	[acf_rating_field name="FIELD_NAME" type="post"]

To get the field value from another post, use the attribute `id`:

	[acf_rating_field name="FIELD_NAME" id="POST_ID"]

If the rating field is linked to a user, set the type `user` in the shortcode. By default, it'll look at custom fields for the current user:

	[acf_rating_field name="FIELD_NAME" type="user"]

To specify a specific user, set the attribute `id`:

	[acf_rating_field name="FIELD_NAME" type="user" id="USER_ID"]
